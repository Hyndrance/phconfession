        <b>About</b>
				</h5>
        <p>
						Imagine a social platform where you can vent out and express your feelings without revealing your true identity.
						A place where you can tell your stories from the most unforgettable to the wildest experience, your dream,
						fantasy or even your deepest secrets. No one will find out who you are but everyone will give their opinion,
						good or bad, to make you stronger and move forward. PH Confession was created for this sole purpose and to
						simply allow you to let it out.
				</p>

	        <b>Privacy</b>
					</h5>
	        <p>
						We take privacy seriously as we respect everyone's preference to keep their identity anonymously.
						We don't collect any personal information such as email, name or contact number. Our one-time registration
						only requires an "alias" and password for security purposes and ownership of your posts. Other than that,
						no other requirement is needed and you may freely start using our service.
						<br><br>
						This platform is primarily intended for users from the Philippines. However we certainly allow everyone
						(yes literally everyone) to use and enjoy using our service.
					</p>

	        <b>DISCLAIMER</b>
					</h5>
	        <p>
						PH Confession will not be held responsible for any personal or emotional damage that it may incur to
						anyone who is using our platform. Since there's no age requirement or sign up process, we will not filter
						 nor manage any "confession" that may contain mature content or foul language as it defies our main
						 vision which is the freedom of expression. Everyone is deemed responsible for their "confession" and
						 comments. Everyone should be aware of the risk of putting their selves into a possible shameful or
						 negative situation so think before you post your confessions. As always our ultimate reminder is "confess
						 responsibly".
